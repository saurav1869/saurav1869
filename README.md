# Hi there, I'm Saurav ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate software developer with a knack for deep learning and machine learning techniques. I did my Masters from University of Freiburg, Germany in Computer Science with special focus on Computer Vision and Deep learning. 

### My project on 3D object detection

In my free time I also like to do things to increase my productivity. For example, I wrote a web extension for Chrome and Firefox users which can provide meaning and pronunciation of any double-clicked word and also saves the looked-up words locally. It has around 400+ users worldwide.
